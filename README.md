My first Odin project! Here goes nothing...

Here goes nothing, I think I'm ready to submit my first project. I spent a couple of hrs more and less after my 9-5 job. Finding the time and mental energy was the hardest part. I still don't understand padding,margins, px em with position: but I like playing around with it.  My divs are shuffling around when I resize the page. CSS is the fun part and also the most frustrating. Overall It felt like a painting and it was fun looking for answers. Thank you Odin! and any feedback is welcome.
